# Radar-System-Project-using-Arduino-Uno-and-Processing
Arduino Radar System Project – A simple radar simulation built using **Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04), and Servo Motor**, with a **Processing-based GUI** to visualize detected objects in real-time. The radar scans 180° and displays distance data on the computer screen in a radar-like interface.
